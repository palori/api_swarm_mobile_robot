The project consists of designing. building and programming a multiple mobile robot system. It is developed to be 3 robots but it can easily be scaled up to more units.<br>
<br>
The project consists about:<br>
- `drawings` the design of the structure of the robots and the analysis of the forces<br>
- `hardware` physical components that form each robot<br>
- `software` the logic of the robots<br>
<br>

## Drawings
(still to write about)<br>
<br>

## Hardware
The hardware ... (still to work on it)<br>
2 boards<br>
Low level board: interaction with sensors (2 IR, 1 IMU, 2 encoders...)
                 and actuators (2 motors, 2 servos...)<br>
<br>

## Software
The software is divided in 2 groups (one for each board):<br>
- low-level<br>
- high-level<br>
<br>

## Matlab
