# Tests
The paths to the files in the `Makefile` / `CMakeLists.txt` for each test must be updated. It will not compile now :)<br>
<br>
Also bear in mind that some functions from the libraries might have been updated and might remain unchanged in the tests making them fail when attempting to compile.
