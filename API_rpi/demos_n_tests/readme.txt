Run shell scripts to compile and run the tests from the terminal.
(Eg.: sh filename.sh)

To make it executable just type in the terminal:
chmod +x filename.sh

Then you will be able to run it also with this command:
./filename

It automatically deletes the executable files after showing the results in the terminal to keep the folder organized.
If the demo/test contains a while true, then the 'executable' is moved to the folder "/executables".
