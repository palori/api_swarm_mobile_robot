# Connect to robot rpi #
########################

1. Turn on hotspot (now only in Pau's phone)
2. Connect the PC to that network
3. Check that at least 2 devices are connected (1 PC and at least 1 robot)
   - can check using ping:
     ping 192.168.43.N
                     138
                     38
                     174
                     ...
4. SSH the robot
   ssh -X user@192.168.43.N
   where user is the username of the robot (pi, local...)
   Introduce the password when asked for (egg, grenen, raspberry...)
5. Navigate to the folder where you have the script, compile it and run it
   cd ~/api_swarm_mobile_robot/API_rpi/image_proc/tests/detect_line		(might be another one)
   ls
   cmake .
   make
   ls 					(looking for the executable file to run, usually the green one)
   ./executable_file	(run the executable)
